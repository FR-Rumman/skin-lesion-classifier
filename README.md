Impact on society/environment
The monkeypox outbreak originated from the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), a severely underdeveloped
country that lies on Central Africa. The ongoing conflict
between the government and M23 rebels have caused the
situation of the outbreak way worse, displacing millions,
disrupting the healthcare system and delaying the
vaccination efforts. With access to mobile devices,
individuals in affected regions can leverage our model to
quickly detect monkeypox symptoms and take preventive
measures before the condition worsens. Furthermore, our
model has the potential for application beyond monkeypox,
assisting the early detection of the recent measles outbreak
in Texas, United States.
